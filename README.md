# Julia Clepf Cybersecurity Blog

Welcome to the repo for my personal blog, built with [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).  
The blog is live here 👉 [julmgc.github.io](https://julmgc.github.io)

## 📝 About this blog

I use this space to share:

- 🔐 **Projects** – full write-ups of cybersecurity labs I build
- 🧪 **Labs** – hands-on experiments with pfSense, Proxmox, VLANs, Wireshark, etc.
- 📚 **Studies** – notes on malware, viruses, and whatever I’m currently researching

The goal: document my journey into cybersecurity, show my technical growth, and create resources that might help others along the way.
